I've created a basic library management system with three main tables:

books - Stores book information including availability
members - Stores library member details
loans - Tracks book borrowing history

The sample data includes:

25 popular books with various genres and publication years
15 library members with contact information
10 loan records with different statuses (Borrowed, Returned, Overdue)

I've separated the database structure into distinct files:

Table Structure Files:

books_table.txt - Contains the books table structure
members_table.txt - Contains the members table structure
loans_table.txt - Contains the loans table structure

Data Files:

books_data.txt - Contains all book records
members_data.txt - Contains all member records
loans_data.txt - Contains all loan records
