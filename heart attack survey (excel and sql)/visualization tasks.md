Here are 12 Excel visualization tasks, one for each scenario. These tasks are designed to combine both tasks within each scenario into a single visualization and cover a variety of Excel graph types:

---

### **Scenario 1**
**Visualization Task:**  
Create a CHART with:
- A column chart showing the average BMI and chlrosetrol level for patients with heart attack likelihood 
- A line graph showing the count of patients with BMI > 30 and high stress levels who are likely to have a heart attack.

---

### **Scenario 2**
**Visualization Task:**  
Use a **stacked bar chart** to display:
- Count of heart attack likelihood (Yes/No) for individuals with moderate physical activity levels and their average cholesterol levels.
- Count of physical activity levels for individuals with cholesterol > 200.

---

### **Scenario 3**
**Visualization Task:**  
Create a **clustered column chart** showing:
- SES categories on the x-axis.
- Separate columns for the total count of stress levels and the count of individuals with high stress levels.

---

### **Scenario 4**
**Visualization Task:**  
Generate a **100% stacked bar chart** to represent:
- The percentage distribution of `BMI (kg/mÂ²)` by  gender.
- The likelihood of heart attacks categorized by gender and `stress levels`

---

### **Scenario 5**
**Visualization Task:**  
Create a **scatter plot with a trendline** to show:
- Correlation coefficients for BMI and chrlosterol levels grouped by gender and age group


---

### **Scenario 6**
**Visualization Task:**  
Use a **box-and-whisker plot** to depict:
- Screen time categories (low, moderate, high) on the x-axis.
- Standard deviation of screen time hours and their association with heart attack likelihood.

---

### **Scenario 7**
**Visualization Task:**  
Generate a **pie chart** for:
- The percentage distribution of individuals with a family history of heart issues and >240 cholesterol levels 

---

### **Scenario 8**
**Visualization Task:**  
Use a **column chart** to display:
- Average systolic and diastolic blood pressure for individuals with heart attack likelihood = Yes.
-

---

### **Scenario 9**
**Visualization Task:**  
Create a area chart** to show:
- Standard deviation, variance, minimum, maximum, and mode BMI values grouped by age and gender.
- Overlay the average cholesterol levels for individuals with BMI ≥ 30.
