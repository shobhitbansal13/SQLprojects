-- HeartAttackSurvey is a data-driven project aimed at exploring the connections between various factors
(such as lifestyle, genetics, and health indicators) and the risk of heart attacks in the young population.
The goal is to identify key risk factors that contribute to heart disease in young individuals and raise awareness
about preventive measures. By analyzing survey data, medical records, and other health parameters, this project seeks
to provide insights that can help mitigate heart attack risks and promote healthier living among younger generations.

I have extracted the data seperately from the main dataset and created tables.Have used table wizard in Mysqlworkbench to easily import data from excel
file to mysql table using queries given in heartattack.table structure file.

The Project contains:

- 4 tables
- Scenarios which extensively cover every aspect of data analysis and use cases
- Visualization Tasks to summarize the data extracted in the scenarios
- Conclusion readme file for the results of the analysis for Heart attack risks in Youth
