### **Conclusion**

The analysis was conducted using a combination of Pivot Tables and SQL queries. Some of the visualizations were created using Pivot Tables, allowing for quick summaries and easy exploration of the data. Other visualizations were based on SQL queries, which directly pulled and processed data into the worksheet for more detailed calculations. This mix of methods ensured a comprehensive analysis, providing both high-level insights and more in-depth findings.

The project helped me take my excel and sql skills to another level.Thanks.
